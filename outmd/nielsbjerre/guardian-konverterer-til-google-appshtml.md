# Guardian konverterer til Google Apps

**Feb 24, 2009**

Technology director Andy Beale siger: "

“We were looking for a system that would address our needs for a more productive and collaborative workplace”. "We looked at a lot of enterprise wiki-type products, and also what IBM was doing with its Lotus products. But we really just decided that the key, de facto things were office and email, and Google was a model people were familiar with."

"Users needed little encouragement to make the change, and support requirements have been minimal".

"One of the joys of it was cutting out a lot of the implementation stuff. You just kind of switch it on."

He is confident that the new set up “will pay for itself in a relatively short period of time, in comparison to our license costs for Lotus"
